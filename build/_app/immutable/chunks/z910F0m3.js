Nothing groundbreaking—simple, accessible UI pieces that work well together.</p> <h2>Philosophy</h2> <ul><li><strong>Minimal by default</strong> - Only what you need, nothing more</li> <li><strong>Accessible</strong> - Proper semantics and keyboard navigation</li> <li><strong>Unstyled (mostly)</strong> - Bring your own styles, or use the minimal defaults</li> <li><strong>No dependencies</strong> - Just Svelte</li></ul> <h2>Why make this?</h2> <p>Honestly? I kept rebuilding the same components across projects. Figured I’d package them up properly and maybe they’d be useful to someone else too.</p> <hr/> <p>That’s it.
