## What is this?

Just a small collection of components I've built and refined while working on various projects. Nothing groundbreakingâ€”simple, accessible UI pieces that work well together.

## Philosophy

- **Minimal by default** - Only what you need, nothing more
- **Accessible** - Proper semantics and keyboard navigation
- **Unstyled (mostly)** - Bring your own styles, or use the minimal defaults
- **No dependencies** - Just Svelte

## Why make this?

Honestly? I kept rebuilding the same components across projects. Figured I'd package them up properly and maybe they'd be useful to someone else too.

## A note

This is a passion project! Expect rough edges and the occasional breaking change. If something doesn't work or could be better, feel free to open an issue
...or don't. It's all good.
